# Common Fact Base Template (for GitHub)

### What Is a Common Fact Base?
A comprehensive set of information that allows all stakeholders (past, present, and future) to have a shared understanding of important facts and information about a given problem, project, or decision.

#### How to Use This Template
* Fork the GitHub repo.
* You could copy and paste or import it into a wiki page or collaborative platform.
* Fill out all applicable fields.
* Customize as needed. Delete the tops, unused sections, etc.
* Publish early and update often.
  * You could incorporate it into an existing project wiki or website.
  * As your project or decision progresses, continue to build out new sections
    and add details. You might want to break this into smaller documents.
* Use collaboration and feedback features to support your open decision making process,
  e.g. comments, polls.

#### Make It Comprehensive, Yet Consumable.
Use the [inverted pyramid](https://www.s8080.com/blog-news/writing-detail-pages-information-pages) method to organize content.

#### Have a Project Charter?
If you compelted a [project charter](https://www.smartsheet.com/blog/project-charter-templates-and-guidelines-every-business-need), publish it as the first piece of your common fact base. As your project progresses, build your common fact base by adding info suggested in this template.

#### Decisions to Make Before Publishing
* Where will you publish? The idea place is:
  * easy for your project team to update and manage
  * easy for your stakeholders to access and navigate

* Who will be able to view this and other documents?
  * At Red Hat, we default to open. If there's no good reason to restrict access, we try to make it visible to everyone.
  * That said, organizational cultures and norms vary, so make sure your project sponsor and teams are comfortable. Discuss the risks and benefits.
  * For highly sensitive projects, consider slowly opening access in concentric circles.
  * If a project is "sensitive" simply because people may react negatively, you can build trust and respect (and [give people time to navigate the grief curve](http://www.whatnextconsultancy.co.uk/blog/managing-change-change-curve.aspx)) by being open from the start.

The template begins below.
-------

# [Name of your decision of project]

## Problem
Problem statement (*1-2 sentences*)
* Learn more (link to details below)
* Problems we're not trying to solve (link to ever-growing list)

### Objectives
* What you want to do about the problem, in broad terms. Desired future state.
* What "good" would look like, in 1 - 2 sentences that anyone can understand.
* May not be needed, if captured in problem statement.

### Who May Be Impacted
* Hint: they are usually your stakeholder groups and potential stakeholder groups.

## Open Decision Making Targets
Based on our project team's experience and the scope of this project, we are aiming to demonstrate the following [maturity levels](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework/tree/master/maturity-model) as we apply the [Open Decision Framework](https://github.com/red-hat-people-team/open-decision-framework):

| Communication | Transparency | Release Early + Release Often | Collaboration |
|:-------------:|:------------:|:-----------------------------:|:-------------:|
| ESTABLISHED | TRANSFORMATIVE | ESTABLISHED | TRANSFORMATIVE |

# What We've Learned So Far
* Shoft the wording of headlines like these, as your project progresses

## Possible Approaches
* In the early states, list any option or solution under evaluation or consideration.
  * As your project progresses, update heading (e.g. "Approaches we're testing," then "Proposed solution").
* [Learn about other solutions considered](#) (*link*)

## Business Requirements
* High-level, most important requirements (up to 5)

## Constraints
* Key constraints on the decision or project
* Include relevant legal, reporting, confidentiality, etc. factors (to the extent possible)

## Assumptions
This is where you'll want to state the obvious (and invite others to question your reasoning). Need help?
* [Requirements vs constraints vs assumptions](https://www.bridging-the-gap.com/ba-stories-its-not-all-requirements-assumptions-and-constraints-matter-too/)
* [Have You Checked Your Assumptions Lately? | Inc.com](https://www.inc.com/robert-kaplan/have-you-challenged-your-assumptions-lately.html)

## Risks
* Known risks, potential areas of controversy, cultural impacts, unintended impacts

## Decision Criteria
* High-level, most important criteria
* Weighted importance

### Scope
* Clearly define what's in and out of scope. Link to details explaining why, if needed.

### Tradeoffs
* When you have to give something up to gain something better, explain it here.

### Revisiting This Decision
When do you anticipate revisiting this decision? Timeline or criteria or key factors that would contribute.

### How to Provide Feedback After Launch
* Think about this, then include some version in your fact base at each phase of the project, to demonstrate your willingness to own the outcome of the decision.

## Research

### Feedback Gathered
* Summarize + link to details
* Changes made based on feedback
* Changes not made, despite feedback (and why)
* Prototype + user testing results
* Post-launch feedback and metrics

### Data and Findings
* Summarize and link to details

## Background

### History + Context
This is probably the first paragraph of your first draft or launch communications. Sorry, it belongs down here.

### About the Problem
The super detailed version of the "Problem" section goes here.

Problems we're ***not*** trying to solve:
* Related problems that you know people will ask you about
* Related things you wish you could solve, but cannot
* Optional, but very helpful to include

Detailed business requirements:
* Requirement #1: Details here to help others understand it
* Requirement #2: Details here to help others understand it
* Order from most to least important. Include info like weighting, relative importance, etc.
* Link to detailed requirement documents, if it's complex.

#### How We Gathered the Requirements
*Explain the process and stakeholders you worked with, external research, etc. Helps validate them.*
* *Link to detailed data, survey results, etc.*

### Other Solutions Considered
(could provide a solutions evaluation matrix, instead)

Eliminated early on:
* Name + why
* Name + why

Eliminated later in the process
* Name + why
+ Name + why

Good solutions that we didn't move forward with:
* Name + why (e.g. higher cost, might reconsider in the future, etc.)
